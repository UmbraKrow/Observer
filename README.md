# Observer

Observer is a platform for tracking service deployments and exposing service status via a public status page.

The project consists of two parts:
- **Observer Admin** — a private interface for managing services and deployments
- **Observer Status** — a public-facing status page for communicating service health

This repository contains the initial MVP definition and will evolve incrementally.

## MVP Scope

The initial MVP focuses on:
- Manual tracking of deployments
- Automatic service status calculation
- Public status page with incident history
- Clear separation between private management and public visibility

No real CI/CD integrations are included at this stage.

## Project Status

This project is in an early design and MVP phase.
